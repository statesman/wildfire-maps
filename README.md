Pull maps script
==================

1. Install requests: `pip install requests`
2. Set the `INTERVAL`
3. Create the output directory `mkdir maps`
3. `python main.py`

## dumb mods

* I creatd an alternate version for 10/16. When I first did it, I entered the date incorrectly, so it did not capture overnight :-(

## changes needed

* to run it based on the current date up until 1 a.m. the next day
* to run it no a server.
